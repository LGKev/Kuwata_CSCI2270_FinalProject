/*
 
 my issue was i was trying to make an array of vertices. then have the vertices->next point to the next element in a column
 
 this is not possible because then you get a adjList pointer and a vertex pointer. 
 
 solution was to make an array of linked lists. this way each element in the array is the head of a new node.
 
 then you have access to next and so you can add the new link (if found) to next and say currentNode->next = newestNode2.
 
 so then it can be linked together
 
 this is not a linked list of linked lists. this is an array of linked lists
