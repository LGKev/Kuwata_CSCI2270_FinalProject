Project Summary:
	This project is focusing on the graph data structure and queues and their application towards physics topics. I will use a graph to represent certain topics in physics and show how topics are related by passing through other topics. For example a problem could ask for velocity but only give you energy, you then could have a start point: velocity, and get to the end point: conservation of energy. A queue will be implemented to keep track of the path traversed so that a path can be found from start to finish. This could be useful for students struggling to find the next connection in a problem that may involve many abstract, but related topics. A  queue or linked list could also be used to store various paths.

How To Run:
	input: starting and ending topic	output: gives single path forward
	input: starting only 			output: gives paths to all possible endings (3 max)
	input: end only			output: gives  paths to All possible starts. (3 max)

	input: print all				output: prints all topics in post order
	input: delete				output: delete a topic, remove links
	input: size				output: counts number of topics + infinity cuz 								physics
	input:
